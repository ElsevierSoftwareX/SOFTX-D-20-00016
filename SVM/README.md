# SVM
This is the supervised machine learning algorithm used to classify events.

It classifies the following *Atomic events*:

1. ballDeflection

## Install requirements
Before to start to run the system make sure to have all the required packages.
To install the packages type the following command:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the system
To run the system you should have a dateset folder with the following subfolders:
 - `testing`, the testing dataset
 - `training`, the training dataset

 Each dataset is composed by a series of folders (it doesn't matter the name) with the following files:
 - `Annotations_AtomicEvents_Manual.xml`, the manual annotation file
 - `Annotations_AtomicEvents.xml`, the ground truth of the atomic events
 - `features.log`, the file of the features generated by the EventDetector_Atomic System

To launch the process, open a terminal on `SVM/` and type

```
python3 classifier.py
```
