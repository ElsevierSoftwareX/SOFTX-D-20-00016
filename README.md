# Slicing and dicing soccer


This project presents code for detecting a wide range of complex events in soccer videos starting from
positional data, which were introduced with the paper "Slicing and dicing soccer".
A synthetic dataset from opensource Game Football engine has been generated.
Starting  from  the  opensource  Gameplay  Football  game [https://github.com/BazkieBumpercar/GameplayFootball] 
a syntetic dataset has been generated including 
all the most common events such as goals, fouls, corners, penalty kicks,etc.

# Repository Overview
This repository contains:

1. EventDetector Atomic (with Genetic Optimizer)
2. EventDetector Complex
3. Visualization System
4. Gameplay Football
5. Minor utilities


# Dataset
