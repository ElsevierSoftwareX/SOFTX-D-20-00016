The file "README" has more detailed information.
You should also read the file "docs/guide.html". 

Requirements
=============
-GNU Make.
-SDL 1.2+ (http://www.libsdl.org/).
-An ANSI/ISO C++ compiler. SGE should conform to ANSI/ISO C++.
-Optional:
 -FreeType 2+ (http://www.freetype.org/).
 -SDL_Image (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/index.html).
-Some SDL knowledge.


Compile & install
==================
'make install'


Configure
==========
You can edit the file "Makefile.conf" to configure SGE. At the top of this
file you will see:

C_COMP = y
#USE_FT = n
#USE_IMG = n
#QUIET = y

Remove the comment (#) symbol to activate the control (y/n) of the 
following options:

C_COMP
Makes it possible to link C code to SGE. See the README file for more 
information. Default: y.

USE_FT
Controls the use of the FreeType library. Default: autodetected.

USE_IMG
Controls the use of the SDL_Image library. Default: autodetected.

QUIET
Don't show build status before compiling.


Make options
=============
'make'
Builds a static SGE library (libSGE.a).

'make shared'
Builds a dynamic SGE library (libSGE.so).

'make shared-strip'
Same as 'make shared' but strips symbols from the libSGE.so file.

'make dll'
Builds a win32 dll file (SGE.dll). You must use a win32 cross compiler to do 
this. You must also remove the # symbol on the "SGE_LIBS =...#-lstdc++" line
in Makefile.conf. 

'make dll-strip'
Same as 'make dll' but strips symbols from the SGE.dll file.

'make clean'
Removes compiled files.

'make install'
Builds a dynamic SGE library and installs it with the headers to the same 
install location as SDL. You can change this location by editing the PREFIX
and PREFIX_H lines in Makefile.conf. You must probably be root to install.
