%=============================================

%Sequence of events:
complexEvent0 :- t1 * t2 * t3.

%Concurrent (synchronous) composition of events:
complexEvent1 :- (t2 * t4) # (t5 * t6).

%Disjunction of events:
complexEvent2 :- t0 \/ t1.

%Sequence of events, combined with disjunction:
complexEvent3 :- (t1 * t2 * t3) \/ (t4*t5).

%Negation (with a sequence of events):
complexEvent4 :- (t5 * t6) cnot t7.
